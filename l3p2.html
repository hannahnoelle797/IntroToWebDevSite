		<p> The most important and most powerful that I have learned about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the style tag in the head of a html document. If you only have a minimum amount of 
			styling to do, it is perfect for making your web page aesthetically appealing and easy for the user to find what they want or need. External style sheets are ideal 
			because they prevent any outside users from changing the visuals of the site.  </p>
		<p> The font properties are another aspect of CSS that I found very important to learn. You want to make sure your reader does not have difficulties reading the text on the 
			site. Being able to change the typeface, font family, font size, and font weights is critical for an effective web page. If the reader is unable to read your site, 
			they will leave and never come back.  </p>
		<p> Properly aligning text with photos is vital for effective web pages. Text about a photo needs to appear next to or surround the photo so the reader knows the purpose 
			and meaning behind the photo. If I talk about 3 people and just put in 3 photos of those people in the document, then the reader may not know which photo is which 
			person. Aligning the photo with the corresponding text, like part 1 of lab 2, is the best way to make sure your web page is understandable and not a scrambled 
			mess. </p>
