			One practical use for a slide show is viewing different angles of an object. We see this all the time when looking at things such as cars, clothing, and furniture 
			pieces. It allows the user to see different angles of the object.<br />For example, let&apos;s say I want to buy a shirt. To ensure that I like the shirt I want to 
			be able to see the front and the back of the shirt. Having a slide show go between the two images would be very useful. If the back of the shirt<br />had a strange 
			design on it, but I couldn&apos;t flip between the images to see it, I would be very disappointed when I recieved the shirt. This also applies to buying a car or 
			viewing pieces of furniture. I want to know that I like every<br />angle of the object before purchasing.<br />
			Another use for a slide show is for companies or organizations that hold events. Placing a slide show onto their site would allow users to cycle through 
			&quot;fliers&quot; and see each event is occuring. Being able to cycle through endlessly<br />makes sure that the user can go back to the slide of an event if they 
			skip it. I've seen this on websites for libraries, high schools, and colleges. It could also be useful for businesses that do events for their employees.
