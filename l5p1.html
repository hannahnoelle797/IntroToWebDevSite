			I chose to use the zIndex method because it was easier to accomplish. Looking at examples using visability, I felt as though it would require making two images
			hidden rather than just moving a single image forward.<br />The result of using visability would mean more code and more opportunity to mess up. I could 
			accidentally hide the wrong images and get an incorrect result. Using zIndex meant I had to create one function and move<br />only one image. This is preferred 
			as there is less chance for error.<br />
			To accomplish the task, I created a function called moveToTop which takes the id of the image that matches the button as a
			parameter. For example, the Chisels button will pass the parameter &apos;chisels&apos; when clicked.<br />Inside the method, I have variables for the current top 
			image (curTop and cTop) and variables for the new top image(newTopImg and nTop). newTopImg is the variable name for the function parameter. The style<br />of the 
			current image (curTop)and the style of the new top image (newTopImg) are retrieved and stored as cTop and nTop, respectively. The zIndex for cTop is set to zero, 
			and the zIndex for nTop is set to 10. curTop is<br />then changed to the value of newTopImg. As a result, the proper image becomes the top image when its 
			respective button is clicked.
